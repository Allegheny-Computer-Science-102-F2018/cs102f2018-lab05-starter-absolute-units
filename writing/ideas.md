For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.

### Idea 1
#### 1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Idea 1 is that we would make a program that a company could use to manage it's clientele in terms of making decisions based on questions given to them. The program would allow the user to add clients and their responses to some specified questions. The program would then give a determination about what action to take based on the clients' responses. The program could also possibly allow the user to remove clients and their responses. Additionally, the program could also output the users information, responses, and the program's determination to a file. It could also read this file in to update it.

For example, our program could be made for a doctor's office. The program would allow the user to add clients and their responses to questions about possible illnesses. The program would then output a determination on whether or not the client should go to the doctor, based on the responses. The program could then save these responses in a document. Another example comes in the financial sphere of today's world, in the term of whether a client should buy a certain stock or not. Similarly to the last example, the program would ask clients questions, in this case about their financial well-being and the stock's recent trends. It would then use a truth table to give a determination about whether or not the client should buy the stock.

If completed this idea would be a good way to show the connection between the idea of the propositional logic truth tables of discrete mathematics, computer science concepts, and real-world/everyday applications of these ideas.
#### 2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
This idea is connected to computer science in a few ways. Mainly, to create this program we would have to use computer science concepts in order to create it. One of these concepts that can be found in Python is the concept of a truth table. Truth tables are a table of combinations of truths with connectives (logical operators). They define the truth value of every connective. Utilization of truth tables is how the program would complete it's task of coming out with a determination based on the client's responses to questions. Another concept that would be used is that of classes and objects. In computer science and Python, objects are usually containers for types of data. A class is an object constructor of sorts. The class could construct objects that are related to the inputted client answers. These concepts would be used to add client information into the program quickly and easily, relating to the project idea.

Overall, this project idea is connected to computer science because it exemplifies the ideas of computer decision making based on computer interaction.

#### 4) What is the central thesis to the article?

#### 5) How will this article support your idea?


### Idea 2
#### 1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Another idea that we have for a class project would be to make a maze game of sorts using graphs and graph theory. The user would be given a maze and would have to input which way they want to go in order to try to exit it. If they are able to exit the maze, they win the game.

This idea is connected to the idea of discrete structures from graph theory. It would be a fun way to show the connection between graph theory in discrete structures, computer science, and games.
#### 2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
This idea is connected to connected to computer science because it uses the idea of graphs and graph theory.
