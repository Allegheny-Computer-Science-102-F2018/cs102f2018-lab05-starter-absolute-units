### Idea 1
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
- Make a program that a company could use to manage it's clientele in terms of making decisions based on questions given to them. The program would allow the user to add clients and their responses to some specified questions. The program would then give a determination about what action to take based on the clients' responses. The program could also possibly allow the user to remove clients and their responses. Additionally, the program could also output the users information, responses, and the program's determination to a file. It could also read this file in to update it.
- For example, our program would likely be made for a doctor's office. The program would allow the user to add clients and their responses to questions about possible illnesses. The program would then output a determination on whether or not the client should go to the doctor, based on the responses. The program could then save these responses in a document.
