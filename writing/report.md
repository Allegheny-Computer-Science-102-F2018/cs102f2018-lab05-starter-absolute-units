<!-- Your final report should highlight the key contributions of your work and consist of at least six high quality paragraphs with a minimum of 200 words in each. The report should include a description of why the chosen topic is important and discuss the implementation that you undertook. The written material should be precise, formal, appropriately formatted, grammatically correct, informative, and interesting. In summary, your report should include:
• The motivation for your project. Why is the application you chose important/useful?
• Detailed description of the work you completed for this project. Without giving a snapshot of the code you wrote, provide technical description of what you implemented and how you implemented it. In particular include software requirements and software design for your project.
• UML diagrams or a flowchart showing your project’s software design (e.g., how classes are interacting with each other). To see an example of including an image in the Markdown document, please see “Mastering Markdown” GitHub guide found at https://guides. github.com/features/mastering-markdown/.
• Description of your results. Make graphs, tables, snapshots of your output, or anything else that can help me understand your results.
• Conclusion. Give a short overview of your project and its results. Describe what you learned, what were the biggest challenges and the biggest rewards.
• If you worked in a team, you should also include a paragraph that describes the team work and the contribution of each team member. -->
