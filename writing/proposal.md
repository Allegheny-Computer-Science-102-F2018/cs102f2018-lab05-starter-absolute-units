# Proposal
In today's world, good decision making is extremely important for any business to be successful. For example, a bank must be careful when lending money, because if it chooses someone who is financially unstable, they risk losing a lot of money. As a result, our group has decided to create a program that uses user-inputs, truth tables, and a variety of other concepts in order to create a program for a sample bank that judges whether or not a potential loan candidate should actually receive a loan. This Python program could potentially help a bank be more financially successful. This project, made using Python, truth tables, and more, is important in today's financial climate because companies need to have better decision making than ever to be successful financially.
