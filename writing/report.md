### Date: 3 Dec 2018
### Group Member Names: Robert Samuel, Christian Lussier, Mikey Spurr, Trent Faulkner
<!-- Your final report should highlight the key contributions of your work and consist of at least six high quality paragraphs with a minimum of 200 words in each. The report should include a description of why the chosen topic is important and discuss the implementation that you undertook. The written material should be precise, formal, appropriately formatted, grammatically correct, informative, and interesting. In summary, your report should include:
• The motivation for your project. Why is the application you chose important/useful?
• Detailed description of the work you completed for this project. Without giving a snapshot of the code you wrote, provide technical description of what you implemented and how you implemented it. In particular include software requirements and software design for your project.
• UML diagrams or a flowchart showing your project’s software design (e.g., how classes are interacting with each other). To see an example of including an image in the Markdown document, please see “Mastering Markdown” GitHub guide found at https://guides. github.com/features/mastering-markdown/.
• Description of your results. Make graphs, tables, snapshots of your output, or anything else that can help me understand your results.
• Conclusion. Give a short overview of your project and its results. Describe what you learned, what were the biggest challenges and the biggest rewards.
• If you worked in a team, you should also include a paragraph that describes the team work and the contribution of each team member. -->

## Report
In today's world, businesses must have good decision making if they want to have any hope of being financially successful. For a bank or loan agency, decision making when giving out loans is an essential task that can contribute to economic profit or disaster. Similarly, for the loan applicant, they should be judged fairly when getting a loan, regardless of economic class. For our project, we decided to create a Loan Eligibility Determinator program that could theoretically be used by a bank or loan agency when determining whether or not a loan applicant should be granted the loan. Created in Python, this program uses the ideas of truth tables and boolean logic to generate an eligibility determination based on the applicants responses to one or both of two question sets. This Python project, utilizing truth tables and boolean logic, accurately determines a loan applicant's eligibility, something that is more important than ever for banks and loan agencies to be successful in today's financial climate.

There were a variety of motivating factors that contributed to our decision to create our Loan Eligibility Determinator. One of these motivations came from our groups interest in learning more about truth tables and boolean logic after learning about them in class and experimenting with them in a lab. After these experiences, we felt that truth tables and boolean logic could be used for a wide range of topics. With this in mind, we began to think of how we could use these Python and discrete structures concepts in conjunction with Economics, since three of our groups members are minoring (or double-majoring) in Economics. After some online research, group discussion, and a conversation with Professor Bonham-Carter, we settled on the idea of making a Python program that would determine loan eligibility using concepts learned in CS102.
